<h1>2021 Recap: They Can't Doubt You If You Don't Lose - Fairfield</h1>

<i>"Come catch the spirit, Fairfield U"</i>

<p>Fairfield started their season one month later than most, but they played like they were in mid-season form.  They opened the season with four dominant wins giving them the #12 power ranking at the beginning of April, 4-0. 8-0 after sweeping Iona.  10-0 after Quinnipiac. Fairfield shutout Rider 3 times during a 4-game series sweep, and they'd move up to #4 in the country and 14-0.
They add two more wins and another 4 game sweep, this time vs #61 Monmouth NJ.</p>

<i>"For all to hear it, Fairfield U"</i>
<i>"Red and White will always conquer"</i>

<p>After a 20-0 start, Fairfield was on top of the college baseball world, power ranked #1.</p>
<p>22-0 after 2 games vs St. Peters. 26-0 after Manhattan. Due to strength of schedule Fairfield would drop to #6, despite their 26-0 start.</p>

<p>In May, Fairfield would hit some roadbumps. On May 2nd, #251 Seina would upset #6 Fairfield, handing them their first loss of the year. Fairfield would lose two more games in May, but head into a regional featuring Southern University, Arizona St, and Texas as the #19 team in the country.</p>

<p>They'd go 1-1 vs #37 Arizona State, beat Southern University, but lose 2-12 vs #4 Texas on June 6th to end their season.</p>

<p>The two regional losses gave the power ranking major doubts about Fairfield and they'd end the season #105, with 1 win over a top 50 opponent and 4 losses to opponents outside the Top 100.</p>

<i>"All across the land we'll always stand by Fairfield U"</i>

<p>For one week, Fairfiend was mathematically the best team in baseball. In 2021, only five teams were able to see their name at the top of the power ranking: Oklahoma State, Vanderbilt, Arkansas, Oregon, and FAIRFIELD U.</p>
