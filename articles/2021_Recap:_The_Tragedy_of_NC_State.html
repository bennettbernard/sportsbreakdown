<h1>2021 Recap: The Tragedy of North Carolina State</h1>

<i>They carry themselves like a team that was designed for this moment, all playing for the university they love. In other words, they were built for this.  Just like their coach.</i> <p>-ESPN.com "College World Series 2021 - Elliot Avent and NC State were built for this moment"</p>

<p>That article was published on June 25, 2021.
<p>
On June 26th, the Washington Post ran a headline "N.C. State, derailed by covid-19 issues, is out of the College World Series after NCAA decision"
</p>
<p>
College baseball fans watched the events playout in real time. In 48 hours the hottest team in baseball was disqualified from the Colelge World Series, despite only 1 loss.
</p>
<p>
They began the season 4-6 and were ranked 94th in the initial power ranking. They'd be swept by Louisville, turn around and sweep North Carolina, then lose 2 of 3 vs Clemson. Momentum began to build for then #52 NC State.  They stole a victory over #12 Notre Dame and swept #35 Virginia Tech. In mid-May, they'd sweep #26 Pitt and take 2 of 3 vs #16 Florida State.
</p>
<p>
#20 NC State would get a regional pairing against #29 Louisiana Tech.  They'd beat Alabama and Louisiana Tech twice to go to the Super Regionals against #1 Arkansas. Arkansas would take game 1 in domiant fashion. But NC State would come back with two 1-run upsets over the #1 team in the nation, and punch their ticket to Omaha.
</p>
<p>
After defeating #7 Stanford, #9 NC State would take on #3 Vanderbild, a pitching duel decided by a Terrell Tatum home run in the 5th.
</p>
<p>
NC State's roster would be depleted for the following game due to COVID testing and cases, resulting in a 1-3 loss.  The rest is a tragedy of the COVID-19 era.  NC State would be disqualified from their third game against Vanderbilt, ending their national title run.
</p>
<p>
NC State would finish their season power ranked #10, having played the 7th most difficult schedule in the nation.

</p>

<i>We're behind you
Keep fighting for State.
Rise up to the fray,
And let your colors wave,
Shout out for dear old NC State</i>
